For almost fifteen years, old Berta had spent every day sitting outside her
front door. The people of Viscos knew that this was normal behaviour
amongst old people: they sit dreaming of the past and of their youth; they
look out at a world in which they no longer play a part and try to find
something to talk to the neighbours about.
Berta, however, had a reason for being there. And that morning her
waiting came to an end when she saw the stranger climbing the steep hill
up to the village, heading for its one hotel. He did not look as she had so
often imagined he would: his clothes were shabby, he wore his hair
unfashionably long, he was unshaven.
And he was accompanied by the Devil.
'My husband's right,' she said to herself. 'If I hadn't been here, no one
would have noticed.'
She was hopeless at telling people's ages and put the man's somewhere
between forty and fifty. 'A youngster,' she thought, using a scale of values
that only old people understand. She wondered how lone he would be
staying. But just stay one night before moving on to a fate about which
she knew nothing and cared even less.
Even so, all the years she had spent sitting by her front door waiting for
his arrival had not been in vain, because they had taught her the beauty
of the mountains, something she had never really noticed before, simply
because she had been born in that place and had always tended to take
the landscape for granted.
